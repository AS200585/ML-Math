# Vectors and Scalar Multiplication

"""
Vectors is a mathematical object that has both magnitude and direction. 
Vectors are also called and ordered lists of numbers.
They are often represented as arrows in a coordinate system, with the length of the arrow indicating 
the magnitude and the direction of the arrow indicating the direction.
These arrows can be added together or multiplied by a scalar to produce new vectors.

Vectors can be represented in component form, such as (x, y, z), where each component corresponds to a dimension in space.
These components can be manipulated using various mathematical operations, such as addition, subtraction, and scalar multiplication.
Vectors can be represented in matrix form, where each column represents a different vector.
Vectors can also be represented as a single column or row in a matrix, depending on the context.

Vectors can have different orientations - they can be column vectors or row vectors.
Column vectors are represented as a single column of values, while row vectors are represented as a single row of values. 
This is the algebraic interpretation is important when performing operations like matrix multiplication.
There is also a geometric interpretation of vectors, which considers their direction and magnitude in space.
This geometric interpretation is important for understanding concepts like vector addition and scalar multiplication.

Vector-Scalar Multiplication: W = λ x v(vector)
When Lambda (λ) is a scalar and v is a vector, the result of multiplying them is a new vector W.
λ > 1 means stretching the vector in the direction of its components, while λ < 1 means compressing it.
λ = 1 means the vector remains unchanged, and λ = 0 results in the zero vector.
λ < 0 means the vector is flipped in the opposite direction.

In AIML, vectors are used to represent various types of data, such as word embeddings, image features, and more. 
They play a crucial role in machine learning algorithms, particularly in the areas of natural language processing and computer vision.

"""
Dimensionality is the number of components or coordinates needed to specify a point in a space.
It also refers to the number of features or attributes in a dataset, the number of columns in a data table, the number of dimensions 
in a geometric space, and also the number of elements in a vector.

In the context of vectors, it refers to the number of dimensions in which the vector exists.
For example, a 2D vector has two components (x, y), while a 3D vector has three components (x, y, z).

Higher-dimensional vectors can exist in spaces with more than three dimensions, which are often used in machine learning and data analysis.
